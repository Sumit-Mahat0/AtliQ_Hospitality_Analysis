# AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis


AtliQ Grands, a well-established player in the hospitality industry for over 20 years, has been facing a decline in market share and revenue due to increasing competition and ineffective decision-making. To tackle this challenge, the management decided to incorporate Business & Data Intelligence to drive data-backed decisions and optimize performance.   

📂 Data Used   
I worked with five key datasets, including:   
✅ Dim Date – Date-related details   
✅ Dim Hotels – Hotel properties, categories (Luxury/Business), and locations    
✅ Dim Rooms – Room details (Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential)    
✅ Fact Bookings – Booking details (check-in/out dates, revenue, ratings, etc.)    
✅ Fact Aggregate Bookings – Room capacity, successful bookings, and utilization  

🔧 Process Followed    
🔹 Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power Query (ensuring integrity & validation)   
🔹 Data Modeling using Star Schema/Snowflake Schema for optimized relationships    
🔹 Data Visualization & DAX Formulas for generating meaningful insights   

🛠 Tech Stack  
📌 Excel, Power BI, Power Query   
 

📊 Key Hospitality Metrics Learned   
✔ RevPAR = Total Revenue / Total Rooms Available  
✔ Occupancy % (Occ%) = Total Rooms Occupied / Total Rooms Available  
✔ ADR = Total Rooms Revenue / Number of Rooms Sold  
✔ Realization Rate = Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN) / Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN).
